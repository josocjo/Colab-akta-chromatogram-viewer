# AKTA Chromatogram Viewer (Google Colab)

This project provides an interactive Google Colab interface for visualizing chromatograms from AKTA systems. It supports `.zip`, `.res`, and `.result` files exported from UNICORN software and allows fine control over:

- UV absorbance display (280 and 260 nm)
- Fraction markers and labeling
- Secondary Y-axis selection (e.g., conductivity, pH, etc.)
- Axis limits and font sizes

The app is built upon [proteovis](https://github.com/Tsuchihashi-ryo/proteovis), a fork of [PyCORN](https://github.com/pyahmed/PyCORN), and is designed for easy usage in a cloud environment.

## üìò How to Use

1. Click the "Open in Colab" badge below to launch the notebook.
2. Upload your `.zip`, `.res`, or `.result` file when prompted.
3. Use the interactive sliders and controls to adjust the chromatogram view.
4. Optionally select a secondary Y-axis parameter (e.g., conductivity or pH).
5. Analyze or export the resulting plots as needed.
