# AKTA Chromatogram Viewer (Google Colab)

This project provides an interactive Google Colab interface for visualizing chromatograms from AKTA systems. It supports `.zip`, `.res`, and `.result` files exported from UNICORN software and allows fine control over:

- UV absorbance display (280 and 260 nm)
- Fraction markers and labeling
- Secondary Y-axis selection (e.g., conductivity, pH, etc.)
- Axis limits and font sizes

The app is built upon [proteovis](https://github.com/Tsuchihashi-ryo/proteovis), a fork of [PyCORN](https://github.com/pyahmed/PyCORN), and is designed for easy usage in a cloud environment.
